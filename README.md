# translationExchange
Manage and review development project.  Started by the 8WoC 2017 internship team and continued by Wycliffe Associates.

Translation Exchange is a system for oral translators and narrators to securely store their audio files and to invite community checking and review. Translation Exchange is designed for the realities of the developing world: It works 100% off-line via local wifi network and can be run on low-power, low-cost computing devices such as Raspberry Pi. It maintains the same design philosophy as Translation Recorder: simple use, minimal text interface, and attention to audio quality.
